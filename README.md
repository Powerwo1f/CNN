Image classification of fashion items using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

The model architecture includes two convolutional layers with max-pooling, followed by a fully connected dense layer and a softmax output layer. It is trained to recognize patterns and classify images with high accuracy.
